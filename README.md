# dankmemer-farm

Simple script to farm Dankmemer coins with multiple accounts at once.
**Requires:** Proxies, Discord Tokens

## Disclaimer
I don't take responsibility if you get banned from a server or if your Tokens get locked

**All accounts need access to the channel ID you provide. Make sure all accounts are in the server and have send message permission**

## Usage
This script was build for [Python 3.9](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-390/)

How to use.
------------
**1.** Create a folder.

**2.** Place the python file in the folder.

**3.** Place a text file (tokens.txt) with discord Tokens in the folder.
**Call the file "tokens.txt"**. If you change the name, the script won't find your Tokens.

**4.** If you want to run multiple Tokens at once it is recommended adding proxies, to prevent getting rate limited.

Place a text file (proxies.txt) in the folder. Proxies format ("ip:port")

**5.** Run the script and enter your channel ID. All the bots will farm in that channel.
**All your Tokens need access to the channel, so make sure they are joined, and have send message permission.**

**6.** Enter your user ID once prompted. All the bots will transfer all their money to the ID every 3-4 min.

**6. Profit**
